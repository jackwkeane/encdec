# Project Grade: 100.0/100.0
Completed fall of 2021 as a part of Lehigh University's CSE 109: System Software.

# Note:
All programs were written and optimized for X86-64 machines with gcc module 7.10.

# encDec
encDec is a program that focuses on encryption and decryption of a file. The program reads a key and XORs that key with blocks of a plaintext input file to produce an encrypted output file. If run again with the same key used to encrypt, an encrypted input file will be decrypted to yield the original plaintext input.
